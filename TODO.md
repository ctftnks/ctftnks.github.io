# TODO:

## Bugs:
- Tanks can sometimes run into their own bullets while shooting

## Bots reimplementation
- Bot implementation is spaghetti code
- bots shoot guided missiles at walls
- Bots can get stuck onto each other
- Guided Missile spins randomly when there is no target (so do bots)

## Minor features
- own flags could be required to be brought home in CTF

## Enhancement:
- Weapon queue
- different tank types (visually): write a class for that?
- music, especially when holding flag
- update README.md
- let bots pick up powerups on intention

## Long term issues
- better graphics: hand drawn vector graphics
- publishable sounds & sprites

## Wishes
- Powerup that creates Portals
- Powerup that lets tank go through walls
- setting the difficulty per-bot
- button to change from player to bot
- Network functionality
