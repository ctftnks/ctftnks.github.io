# TODO:

## Bugs:
- Tanks spawn outside of Map and then get removed from game.objs by spatial sorting
- two players can pick up the same flag from one base simultaneously

## Minor features
- Laser needs rework: accuracy
- Laser should show trajectory prior to shooting
- when spawning: show first letter of name for identification

## Enhancement:
- less white!
- stats at end of each map: how many kills, deaths does each player have? How much did each player move, shoot?
- different tank types (visually): write a class for that?
- music, especially when holding flag
- change body.background to #555 or similar
- adaptive bot difficulties: bots become harder/easier depending on scoreboard
- update README.md
- REFACTOR REFACTOR REFACTOR!!!

## Long term issues
- better UI
- better graphics: hand drawn vector graphics
- mobile support
- publishable sounds & sprites

## Wishes
- Powerup that creates Portals
- Powerup that lets tank go through walls
- setting the difficulty per-bot
- button to change from player to bot
